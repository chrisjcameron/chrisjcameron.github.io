Christopher J. Cameron, Ph.D

I examine processes of diffusion, mobilization and stratiÔ¨Åcation on social networks in the contexts of political polarization, radicalization, social movements, inequality, and public health. My diffusion research provides new insight about the structure of social networks and the spread of social contagions. My work with link-tracing network sampling produces practical results to support public health work. I apply an interdisciplinary toolkit, including social network analysis, simulation, statistical and computational methods to data derived from social media, surveys, and behavioral experiments.
